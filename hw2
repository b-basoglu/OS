This assignment aims to familiarize you with the development of multi-threaded applications
and synchronization using C. Your task is to implement a simulator for mining (Turkish; maden
çıkarma) by simulating the different agents within the scenario using different threads. Towards
this end, you will be using mutexes, semaphores and condition variables for synchronizing the
different threads.
Keywords— Thread, Semaphore, Mutex, Condition Variable
